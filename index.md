## Introduction

Welcome to **Cloner**.

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our application and services, including what data we currently collect and what features we may offer in the future. We value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how we handle your personal information.

By using Cloner, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.


## Who We Are

**Cloner** is currently operated by an individual developer based in the United States. The app is in early development stages and hosted at [https://cloner-testing.vercel.app](https://cloner-testing.vercel.app).

---

## What Data We Collect

### Currently Collected:

* **Email address** (via Firebase Authentication)
* **Name** (optional, from login provider)
* **Messages you send within the app**
* **Friend profiles and names you create manually**

### Collected in Future Features:

* **Imported message history** (e.g., Facebook Messenger chat exports)
* **Optional user-uploaded photos** (to customize avatars or personas)

All imported data is strictly user-provided and user-controlled.

---

## How We Use Your Data

### We use your data to:

* Authenticate and identify users
* Store and manage your saved chats and friend profiles
* Generate conversational responses from OpenAI
* (Future) Provide more personalized responses based on your message history

We do **not** sell or share your personal data with advertisers or unrelated third parties.

---

## Third-Party Services

Cloner uses the following services:

* **Firebase** for authentication and database storage
* **OpenAI API** for generating chat responses
* (Optional) **Facebook Login** for account access

You may also import message history from platforms like Facebook Messenger. In those cases, we do not access your account â€” you upload data voluntarily.

---

## Data Storage & Security

All user data is stored securely via Firebase Firestore. We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including authentication rules and encrypted transmission.

However, no online platform is 100% secure. Use Cloner at your own discretion and avoid sharing sensitive personal or financial information.

---

## Data Retention

We retain your data as long as your account is active. You may request account deletion and associated data at any time by contacting us at **[brandonhn002@gmail.com](mailto:brandonhn002@gmail.com)**.

---

## Children's Privacy

Cloner is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

---

## Future Use Cases (for transparency)

As Cloner develops, we may:

* Analyze imported chat history to emulate tone, style, and behavior
* Generate synthetic text (and eventually images) to simulate conversations
* Allow users to optionally upload friend photos to generate avatars with AI

If we implement these features, **explicit user consent will be required** prior to use, and all data usage will remain transparent and under user control.

---

## Your Rights

You may:

* Request a copy of your data
* Request deletion of your account and data
* Update your login information

To make a request, contact us at **[brandonhn002@gmail.com](mailto:brandonhn002@gmail.com)**.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as Cloner evolves. Changes will be posted at [https://cloner-testing.vercel.app](https://cloner-testing.vercel.app) with the updated date.
